          ndrew is a member of the Django core team, a Senior Engineer at

          distributed-system-related libraries.

          His work mostly focuses on software and systems architecture, and he
          enjoys nothing more than making systems and tools that other
          engineers can use to get their jobs done more easily, as well as
          doing talks and videos to help break down the challenges of writing
          software at distributed scale. In his spare time, he enjoys piloting
          small planes, archery, and attempting to visit every one of the USAâ€™s
          National Parks.
